This is a React-based e-commerce application where users can view a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API and click on a product to see its details. To access the product list, users must log in or sign up, and their authentication status is stored in localStorage. The app includes user authentication, protected routes, and a clean UI with custom CSS styling. It uses React Router for navigation and Axios for API requests. The project is built using Vite for fast performance. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and start the development server using npm run dev. For deployment on Netlify, the build command is npm run build, and the _redirects file ensures correct routing for React Router. Future improvements include adding a cart system, enhanced UI, and backend authentication. Developed by Manisha.
